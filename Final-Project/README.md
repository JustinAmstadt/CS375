## **Project Overview**

In this project I intend to make a raytracing application. Given that raytracing applications generally can't be done in real-time, my main goals are to get models working and do reflections and refractions. This might take a lot of effort just to do this, but if I finish faster than I expect, I will look into different features or optimization.

## **Project Schedule**

Week 1 - Look into the Metal API and learn how to set up a project on my machine and learn about the shading language they use

Week 2 - Learn how to implement the raytracing pipeline and get a basic shape on the screen

Week 3 - Put the project into 3D and have multiple objects on screen

Week 4 - Do reflection/refraction and model loading

## **Project Technical Requirements**

I intend to use the Metal API, but if I fail to make it happen, use the C++ application I already started creating.

I found [a great tutorial series](https://medium.com/@samuliak) on Metal that will give me the foundation I need before trying to use the raytracing features that are available.

I have also found a minimal example of running Metal without XCode if I fail to figure out how to configure it. This example is already in the repo and has been successfully tested.
